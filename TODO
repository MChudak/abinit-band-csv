!) - important thing to do (severe bug, important feature),
+) - small feature,
++) - big feature,
 -> - additional ideas / features basing on the previous one.

TO DO:

!) There are many kpt datasets in an .out file - program should pick the best (longest?), or maybe ask the user which to take.

+) Delimiter - customisable.

++) Another script to generate basic gnuplot *scripts*.
 -> With recognising of high symmetry points and auto-labelling.
 -> Maybe someone can't use unicode? Should the script support no-unicode mode?
